## Configuring your existing managed Redis

To use Superlinked with Redis, you will need several Redis modules. The simplest approach is to use the official Redis Stack, which includes all the necessary modules. Installation instructions for the Redis Stack can be found in the [Redis official documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/). Alternatively, you can start a managed instance provided by Redis (a free-tier is available). For detailed steps on initiating a managed instance, refer to the [Start a Managed Redis Instance](#start-a-managed-redis-instance) section below.

Once your Redis instance is up and running, ensure it is accessible from the server that will use it. Additionally, configure the necessary authentication settings as described below.

## Modifications in your configuration

To integrate Redis, you need to add the `RedisVectorDatabase` class and include it in the executor. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

To configure your Redis, the following code will help you:

```python
from superlinked import framework as sl

vector_database = sl.RedisVectorDatabase(
    "<your_redis_host>", # (Mandatory) This is your Redis' URL without any port or extra fields.
    12315, # (Mandatory) This is the port and it must be an integer.
    default_query_limit=10, # This optional parameter specifies the maximum number of query results returned. If not set, it defaults to 10.
    # These params must be in a form of kwarg params. Here you can specify anything that the official python client
    # enables. The params can be found here: https://redis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/connections.html. Below you can see a very basic user-pass authentication as an example.
    username="test",
    password="password"
)
```

Once you have configured the vector database just simply set it as your vector database.

```python
...
executor = sl.RestExecutor(
    sources=[source],
    indices=[index],
    queries=[sl.RestQuery(sl.RestDescriptor("query"), query)],
    vector_database=vector_database, # Or any variable that you assigned your `RedisVectorDatabase`
)
...
```

## Start a Managed Redis Instance

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Redis Labs and create database">
  Navigate to [Redis Labs](https://app.redislabs.com/) and sign in.
  
  Click the "New Database" button to start creating your Redis instance.
</Step>

<Step title="Select database type">
  On the database creation page, locate the `Type` selector, which offers two options: `Redis Stack` and `Memcached`.
  
  Ensure `Redis Stack` is selected (it should be pre-selected by default).
  
</Step>

<Step title="Configure basic settings">
  For basic usage, no further configuration is necessary.
  
  Redis has already generated a user called `default` and a password that you can see below it.
  
  <Note>
  Make note of the default username and password as you'll need these for your Superlinked configuration.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Consider production settings (optional)">
  If you intend to use the instance for persistent data storage beyond sandbox purposes, consider configuring:
  - High Availability (HA)
  - Data persistence
  - Other relevant production settings
  
  <Tip>
  For production workloads, review Redis Labs' documentation for recommended configuration options.
  </Tip>

## Example app with Redis

You can find an example that utilizes Redis [here](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked/blob/main/docs/run-in-production/vdbs/redis/app_with_redis.py).
