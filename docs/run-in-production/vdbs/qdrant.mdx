## Configuring your existing managed Qdrant

To use Superlinked with Qdrant, start a managed instance provided by Qdrant (a free-tier is available). For detailed steps on initializing a managed instance, refer to the [Start a Managed Qdrant Instance](#start-a-managed-qdrant-instance) section below.

Once your Qdrant instance is up and running, ensure it is accessible from the server that will use it. Additionally, configure the necessary authentication settings as described below.

## Modifications in your configuration

To integrate Qdrant, you need to add the `QdrantVectorDatabase` class and include it in the executor. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
from superlinked import framework as sl

vector_database = sl.QdrantVectorDatabase(
    "<your_qdrant_url>", # (Mandatory) This is your qdrant URL generally with a port but without any extra fields
    "<your_api_key>", # (Mandatory) This is the api key to your qdrant cluster
    # The following params must be in a form of kwarg params. Here you can specify anything that the official python client enables. For more details visit:
    # https://python-client.qdrant.tech/qdrant_client.qdrant_client.
    default_query_limit=10, # This optional parameter specifies the maximum number of query results returned. If not set, it defaults to 10.
)
```

Once you have configured the vector database just simply pass it to the executor.

```python
...
executor = sl.RestExecutor(
    sources=[source],
    indices=[index],
    queries=[sl.RestQuery(sl.RestDescriptor("query"), query)],
    vector_database=vector_database,
)
...
```

## Start a Managed Qdrant Instance

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Qdrant Cloud and navigate to cluster creation">
  Navigate to [Qdrant](https://cloud.qdrant.io/login) and sign in.
  
  Click on "Overview" on the left side of the page to access cluster management.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose cluster configuration">
  You can create either free-tier or production-ready clusters:
  
  **Free-tier specifications:**
  - 0.5 vCPU
  - 1GB memory  
  - 4GB disk space
  - Running on 1 node
  
  You can also choose your preferred platform, location and whether high-availability (HA) is necessary.
  
  <Note>
  You can customize these parameters with a paid plan for production workloads.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create the cluster">
  After configuring your preferences, create the cluster.
  
  <Check>
  Wait for the cluster to be fully provisioned and show as "Running" status.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Generate and secure API key">
  After the cluster is created, generate an API key and save it to a secure place.
  
  <Warning>
  You won't be able to see the API key again after generation. This key is required for the QdrantVectorDatabase configuration.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example app with Qdrant

You can find an example that utilizes Qdrant [here](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked/blob/main/docs/run-in-production/vdbs/qdrant/app_with_qdrant.py).
