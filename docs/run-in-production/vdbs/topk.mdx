## Configuring your existing TopK account

To use Superlinked with TopK, you'll need to create a TopK account and set up a project. For detailed steps on setting up your TopK account, refer to the [Set up your TopK Account](#set-up-your-topk-account) section below.

Once your TopK project is set up, you'll need to obtain your API key and region information to configure the authentication settings as described below.

## Modifications in your configuration

To integrate TopK, you need to add the `TopKVectorDatabase` class and include it in the executor. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

````python
from superlinked import framework as sl

vector_database = sl.TopKVectorDatabase(
    api_key="<your_api_key>", # (Mandatory) This is your TopK API key
    region="<your_region>", # (Mandatory) This is your TopK region
    default_query_limit=10, # (Optional) This parameter specifies the maximum number of query results returned. If not set, it defaults to 10.
)

Once you have configured the vector database just simply pass it to the executor.

```python
...
executor = sl.RestExecutor(
    sources=[source],
    indices=[index],
    queries=[sl.RestQuery(sl.RestDescriptor("query"), query)],
    vector_database=vector_database,
)
...
````

## Set up your TopK Account

To set up your TopK account and obtain the necessary credentials for Superlinked integration, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to the TopK Console">
  Navigate to [TopK Console](https://console.topk.io) and create an account or sign in to your existing account.
  
</Step>

<Step title="Create or Select a Project">
  TopK follows an `Organization > Project > Collection` hierarchical structure.
  
  Create a new project or use an existing one within your organization.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate an API Key">
  Follow the TopK [documentation](https://docs.topk.io/installation#api-key) to generate an API key for your project.
  
  <Warning>
  Save your API key securely as you'll need it for your Superlinked configuration.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Note your Region">
  TopK is region-specific. Refer to the TopK documentation for available regions and ensure you use the correct region for your project.
  
  <Warning>
  Attempting to access collections or documents outside the specified region will result in a region mismatch error.
  </Warning>
</Step>
