The Superlinked server is designed to be used by end users who want to leverage the power of Superlinked in deployable projects. With a simple command, you can run a Superlinked-powered app instance that creates REST endpoints and connects to external Vector Databases. This makes it an ideal solution for those seeking an easy-to-deploy environment for their Superlinked projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this environment, you need to have:

1. Python 3.11 or higher installed with pip and venv modules. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. A Python virtual environment created and activated in a dedicated project folder of your choice.
3. Install the superlinked-server library: `pip install superlinked-server`

_Note: The following documentation uses Unix-based terminal commands. Compatibility with other operating systems has not been verified._

## How to start the application

To start the application follow the steps below:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the Superlinked app folder">
  Create a directory to store your Superlinked configuration files by running `mkdir superlinked_app`. For a minimal working example, copy the [app.py](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked/blob/main/docs/run-in-production/example/app.py) into your newly created `superlinked_app` directory. For more advanced use cases, please read the next section below.
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Superlinked server">
  To start the server run the `python -m superlinked.server` command.
</Step>
</Steps>

By default, this will start the server on port 8080 (configurable via the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable) and expose the API endpoints for use. You can verify the server is running by visiting http://localhost:8080/docs in your browser.

## Configuring and Customizing Your Application

Once your server is running, you'll need to configure and integrate your application. There are two main aspects to focus on:
