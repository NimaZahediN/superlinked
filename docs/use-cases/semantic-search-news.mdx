This use case implements semantic search in [news](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset) articles. 
The dataset is filtered for news in the 'BUSINESS' category.

We are embedding
- headlines
- news body (short description)
- and date
  
to be able to search for
- notable events, or
- related articles to a specific story.

There is a possibility to skew the results towards older or fresher news,
and also to influence the results using a specific search term.
