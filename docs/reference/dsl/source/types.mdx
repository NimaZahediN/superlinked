description: "Type definitions and utilities for Superlinked data sources"
---

The `types` module provides type definitions and utilities used across the Superlinked source framework. This module contains essential type aliases, generic type definitions, and utility types that support the source infrastructure.

## Module Overview

This module serves as a central location for:

- **Type Aliases**: Common type definitions used across source implementations
- **Generic Types**: Parameterized types for source data handling
- **Utility Types**: Helper types for source configuration and management
- **Interface Definitions**: Type contracts for source implementations

## Integration with Sources

The types defined in this module are used throughout the source framework to ensure:

- **Type Safety**: Consistent typing across all source implementations
- **Generic Support**: Parameterized types for different data formats
- **Interface Compliance**: Standardized contracts for source behavior
- **Development Support**: Better IDE support and error detection

## Usage Context

These types are primarily used internally by:

- **Source Implementations**: All source classes reference these types
- **Parser Integration**: Type definitions for data parser compatibility
- **Schema Validation**: Type support for schema-based validation
- **Application Framework**: Integration with the broader Superlinked type system

The types module ensures consistent behavior and type safety across the entire source framework while providing the flexibility needed for different data source implementations.
