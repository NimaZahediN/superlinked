## Key Features

Registry components provide:

- **Component Management**: Centralized registration and discovery of framework components
- **Configuration Control**: Organized management of component configurations
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic resolution of component dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling for registry operations
- **System Organization**: Structured approach to framework component organization

<Info>
The registry serves as the central hub for managing all Superlinked components, ensuring proper initialization, configuration, and dependency resolution throughout the framework.

## Registry Functions

The registry handles:

1. **Component Registration**: Register new components with the framework
2. **Discovery**: Find and retrieve registered components
3. **Configuration Management**: Manage component configurations centrally
4. **Dependency Injection**: Resolve and inject component dependencies
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Control component initialization and cleanup

<Tip>
The registry ensures all framework components are properly organized and accessible, providing a clean architecture for complex Superlinked applications.
