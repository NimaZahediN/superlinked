title: "Effect"
description: "Conditional interaction within a space that modifies vector behavior based on events or conditions"
---

## Effect

```python
Effect(space, affected_schema_reference, affecting_schema_reference, filter_)
```

An effect represents a conditional interaction within a `Space` where the `affecting_schema_reference` interacted with the `affected_schema_reference`. It allows you to real-time adjust embeddings based on interaction. e.g.: A `User` schema interacts with a `Post` schema, if `event.type == 'like'`.

### Parameters

<ParamField path="space" type="Space[AggregationInputT, EmbeddingInputT]" required>
The space where the effect applies.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="affected_schema_reference" type="SchemaReference" required>
The schema reference that is being affected by the interaction.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="affecting_schema_reference" type="SchemaReference | MultipliedSchemaReference" required>
The schema reference that is causing the effect on the affected schema.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="filter_" type="ComparisonOperation[SchemaField]" required>
The filter condition that determines when this effect should be applied.
</ParamField>
