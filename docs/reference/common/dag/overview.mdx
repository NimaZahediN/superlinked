The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) module provides time-based data processing capabilities, enabling efficient management of temporal data and period-based operations within the Superlinked framework.

## Time Processing Components

Manage temporal data and time-based operations:

    Period-based time management and temporal data processing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Features

The DAG components enable:

- **Temporal Processing**: Handle time-based data operations efficiently
- **Period Management**: Define and manage time periods for data aggregation
- **Time-based Queries**: Enable temporal filtering and analysis
- **Data Flow**: Organize data processing workflows with directed acyclic graphs

<Info>
DAG components are particularly useful for applications that need to process time-series data, manage data freshness, or implement time-based filtering and aggregation.

## Use Cases

Common applications include:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Processing sequential data points over time
- **Data Freshness**: Managing data recency and temporal relevance
- **Period Aggregation**: Grouping data by time periods for analysis
- **Temporal Filtering**: Filtering data based on time constraints
