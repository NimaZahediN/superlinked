Superlinked recipes are standalone applications designed to showcase the powerful capabilities of Superlinked through real-world examples. Each recipe is accessible as a public Streamlit app, allowing for easy experimentation. You can run these projects locally or take advantage of our free-tier cloud solution on GCP. Comprehensive instructions and code are provided, enabling you to deploy the entire application yourself.
