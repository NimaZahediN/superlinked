Superlinked is a Python framework for AI Engineers building <b>high-performance search & recommendation applications</b> that combine <b>structured</b> and <b>unstructured</b> data.

- **WHY**: Improve your vector search relevance by encoding metadata together with your unstructured data into vectors. Read more at [Why Superlinked](/getting-started/why-superlinked)
- **WHAT**: A framework and a self-hostable REST API server that connects your data, vector database and backend services.
- **HOW**: Construct custom data & query embedding models from pre-trained encoders from `sentence-transformers`, `open-clip` and custom encoders for numbers, timestamps and categorical data. See <b>[concepts](/concepts/overview)</b> and <b>[use cases](/use-cases/overview)</b> for examples.
